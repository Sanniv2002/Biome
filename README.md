## What is Biome?
Deploying your containerized server has never been easier. Simply upload your container to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), send a POST request to Biome's Gateway, and voilà—your server is live on the web!
But that's not all. Biome does more than just deploy. It handles scaling, routing, and even those pesky container crashes, so you can focus on what you do best—coding.
let Biome handle the heavy lifting. After all, superheroes deserve a break too.
